### **Who**
GPU node operators

---

### **Timeline**
**Node selection:**  
- **Start:** Friday, October 24, 2025  
- **End:** Friday, October 31, 2025  

**Benchmark testing:**  
- **Start:** Monday, November 3, 2025  
- **End:** Monday, November 17, 2025  

---

### **Selection & Rewards**
1. Node selection will be on a **first come, first served** basis, up to **15 testers**.  
2. Node testing will be performed against our benchmark.  
3. Rewards will be awarded **only if the node passes all initial tests**.  
4. Rewards for the **“Alpha Testers”** initiative will be distributed **within 2–4 weeks** after the final benchmark tests.  
5. Rewards will be sent directly **to the node address**.

---

### **What You Do**
Set up and run an **Ocean Node** with the specified prerequisites and **earn a guaranteed reward**.

---

### **Note**
All technical setup instructions are available at:  
👉 [https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-node](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-node)

Participants should be familiar with **basic Docker operations**, including:
- Pulling and pushing images  
- Starting and stopping containers  
- Inspecting logs  
- Mounting volumes and setting environment variables  
- Basic troubleshooting (e.g., checking container status, resolving port conflicts)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### **Hardware**
| Component | Requirement |
|------------|--------------|
| **CPU** | 2 physical cores (4 threads recommended) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB minimum per GPU |
| **GPU** | At least one discrete GPU with minimum 8GB VRAM (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel) |
| **Disk** | SSD with ≥ 50 GB free |
| **Network** | Stable connection for image pulls and node sync |

---

### **Node Configuration**
| Config | Requirement |
|--------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Add OPF admin address `0xA143fBa5355275dc00F77bdB0C989CD4f54c219C` so logs can be fetched |
| **Exposure** | Node must be reachable via **public IP** |
| **RPC** | Properly configured for **Sepolia Ethereum Testnet** and **Base Mainnet** network |
| **Compute Environment** | At least one compute environment (config provided by OPF) |

---

### **Activity Requirements**
> ⚠️ The node must remain **online and operational** throughout the entire **2-week testing period**.

- Benchmark tests will be run **randomly**.  
- Failure to respond to **any test call** will result in **immediate dismissal** from the *Alpha Testers* initiative and **loss of reward**.

---

## 💰 Rewards
- **Base Reward:** `$100 per node`  
- **Condition:** Reward is granted only after successful participation in **all benchmark tests**.
